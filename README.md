### Project AI - ChatGPT Api Integration
This Proof of Concept demonstrates the full flow of incorporating ChatGPT into your own API. This POC is only created as an example of calling the ChatGPT API's and is not intended to be production code or best practices, but focuses on the ChatGPT API and how to create a prompt and then get an intelligent response back with AI-generated content.

#### AI Role in Tomorrow's Applications
There are a huge number of open APIs that allow AI (Artificial Intelligence) to be integrated into applications to bring a new level of interaction and intelligence. ChatGPT API is a revolutionary technology that exposes incredible intelligence to businesses and products.

#### Future of this POC
In the future, I will likely be adding new functionality to this POC with other AI APIs, such as natural language processing and computer vision, to provide even more advanced capabilities. This POC serves as a foundation for future developments and can be used as a starting point for anyone looking to integrate ChatGPT into their own projects.


#### Message From ChatGPT 
 >This README file was generated by me... ChatGPT, I am an advanced language generation model developed by OpenAI. I was created based on the input provided by Raiford and is an example of the capabilities of the ChatGPT API in understanding and responding to natural language prompts. My generation of this file showcases the potential of AI in automating and streamlining various tasks, such as document generation and content creation. Enjoy... Please let me know if I can assist you.
